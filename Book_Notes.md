# Simulating War: Studying Conflict Through Simulation Games

## Intro

### Conflict

`In games, this competition is mainly artificial, while in war it is mainly situational, but the effect is the same. Both war and games pit humans against one another in a dynamic interactive contest of wits and resources, as the opposing sides struggle to prevail.`

`US military theorist Edward Luttwak wrote that:
[T]he entire realm of strategy is pervaded by a paradoxical logic of its own, standing against the ordinary linear logic by which we live in all other spheres of life (except for warlike games, of course). In settings where conflict is merely incidental to purposes of production and consumption, of commerce and culture, of social relations and consensual governance, with strife and competition more or less bound by law and custom, a noncontradictory linear logic applies, whose essence is captured by what we think of as commonsense`

### History of Wargames

1. Board Games
2. Figure Games
3. Computer Games

`Wargames enthusiasts hence tend to be very reticent in public about their activities, and to cloak them in euphemisms such as ‘conflict simulation’.25 Quite a few prominent writers on military history are themselves wargamers, but you would not know it from their published books.26 Most scholars ignore or dismiss wargaming, for reasons I explore in Chapter 1.27 Games in general suffer from a deep-rooted perception of juvenilia, as illustrated by the remarkably limited attention and respect that the entire modern video games industry receives in the print and broadcast media, despite having a turnover larger than Hollywood.28 As Jane McGonigal put it: ‘Almost all of us are biased against games today – even gamers. We can’t help it. It is part of our culture, part of our language, and it’s even woven into the way we use the words “game” and “player” in everyday conversation.`

## 1 - Modelling War

`‘[A] wargame is a warfare model or simulation whose operation does not involve the activities of actual military forces, and whose sequence of events affects and is, in turn, affected by the decisions made by players representing the opposing sides.’ - Peter Perla`

### Military Simulation Games: 
1. mathematical model of reality simulates terrain, deployment and capabilities of forces, passage of time
2. decision inputs to guide simulated actions of combatants

### Mathematical Modeling

` I much prefer my King’s College colleague Willard McCarty’s view that: ‘[A] model is by nature a simplified and therefore fictional or idealized representation, often taking quite a rough-and-ready form` 

Thucydides and *Polybius* using mathematical calculations to explore the relationship between numbers, depth, spacing, and frontage of troops with a battle line

Enlightenment thinkers like *Vauban* calculated when fortresses would fall given how long to dig trenches and conduct bombardments
