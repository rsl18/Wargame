# Simulating War: Studying Conflict Through Simulation Games

### Conflict

`In games, this competition is mainly artificial, while in war it is mainly situational, but the effect is the same. Both war and games pit humans against one another in a dynamic interactive contest of wits and resources, as the opposing sides struggle to prevail.`

`US military theorist Edward Luttwak wrote that:
[T]he entire realm of strategy is pervaded by a paradoxical logic of its own, standing against the ordinary linear logic by which we live in all other spheres of life (except for warlike games, of course). In settings where conflict is merely incidental to purposes of production and consumption, of commerce and culture, of social relations and consensual governance, with strife and competition more or less bound by law and custom, a noncontradictory linear logic applies, whose essence is captured by what we think of as commonsense`

### History of Wargames

1. Board Games
2. Figure Games
3. Computer Games

`Wargames enthusiasts hence tend to be very reticent in public about their activities, and to cloak them in euphemisms such as ‘conflict simulation’.25 Quite a few prominent writers on military history are themselves wargamers, but you would not know it from their published books.26 Most scholars ignore or dismiss wargaming, for reasons I explore in Chapter 1.27 Games in general suffer from a deep-rooted perception of juvenilia, as illustrated by the remarkably limited attention and respect that the entire modern video games industry receives in the print and broadcast media, despite having a turnover larger than Hollywood.28 As Jane McGonigal put it: ‘Almost all of us are biased against games today – even gamers. We can’t help it. It is part of our culture, part of our language, and it’s even woven into the way we use the words “game” and “player” in everyday conversation.`

## 1 - Modelling War

`‘[A] wargame is a warfare model or simulation whose operation does not involve the activities of actual military forces, and whose sequence of events affects and is, in turn, affected by the decisions made by players representing the opposing sides.’ - Peter Perla`

### Military Simulation Games: 
1. mathematical model of reality simulates terrain, deployment and capabilities of forces, passage of time
2. decision inputs to guide simulated actions of combatants

### Mathematical Modeling

` I much prefer my King’s College colleague Willard McCarty’s view that: ‘[A] model is by nature a simplified and therefore fictional or idealized representation, often taking quite a rough-and-ready form` 

Thucydides and *Polybius* using mathematical calculations to explore the relationship between numbers, depth, spacing, and frontage of troops with a battle line

Enlightenment thinkers like *Vauban* calculated when fortresses would fall given how long to dig trenches and conduct bombardments

Bülow: ‘The agency of military energies, like the other effects of nature, becomes weaker … in an inverse ratio of the square of the distance’ and hence that none of the eleven large European states would be able to conquer another. -disproved by Napoleon

### Lanchester N-Square Law ie. overmatch

`Unfortunately, Lanchester’s model contains several highly dubious assumptions. It makes no allowance for the density of troops increasing their exposure to fire, whereas we know that dispersion has been a key factor in limiting casualty rates as weapons have become more and more effective.15 His model has all shots aimed at surviving enemy forces, rather than inflicting multiple redundant hits on the same targets or even hitting friends who have been misidentified. It assumes that opponents fire simultaneously, and that each shot has only a small chance of hitting its target. More realistic assumptions in any of these areas could easily erode the square law altogether or even give the advantage to the smaller force (especially if it fires first). On the other hand, Lanchester’s model assumes that overmatched troops continue to fire with unchanged effectiveness even while being ground down to utter annihilation, rather than taking cover, fleeing or surrendering without even inflicting the limited enemy casualties that his model predicts.`

`Even professional wargames and simulations, for all their sophistication, often have Lanchester’s equations at their heart, and hence offer at best a vague approximation of real engagements depending on whether his offsetting errors happen broadly to cancel out`

### Operations Research

Tizard and Blackett WWII
Nuclear strategy cold war
Failure at modeling guerilla warfare during Vietnam

`What has changed over time is the sophistication of the modelling, with the most glaring weaknesses of simple Lanchestrian formulae being explicitly addressed so that professional models do now offer challenging and thought-provoking attempts to come to grips analytically with the profound complexities of the combat experience.`

### Game Theory

Nuemann and Morgenstern - Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour

Schelling - Cold War simulation

`The key feature of this non-zero-sum game is that either superpower will gain an advantage from adopting a hawkish stance if its enemy is more restrained, but that both will be worse off in the case of mutual hostility than in the case of mutual restraint. By manipulating the relative numerical payoffs associated with the different boxes, Schelling and similar theorists sought to model three different kinds of superpower competition. One was the nuclear arms race, in which both sides continually built up their arsenals based on worst case planning about ongoing enemy weapons production, but in which both could benefit if they could trust the adversary to display mutual restraint (for instance, through arms control agreements). The second situation was a crisis or limited war, in which threats of escalation could secure a favourable resolution for the more hard line protagonist, but in which mutual hawkishness might trigger Armageddon. The final and most nightmarish scenario was one in which the vulnerability of both side’s nuclear arsenals to a first strike created a ‘reciprocal fear of surprise attack’, such that the least bad option was to fire first even though the ‘victory’ this produced would in this case be far inferior in value to that obtainable by avoiding nuclear war altogether`

### Counterfactual Studies

HG Wells
Stolfi - alternate WWII

`Several scholars, such as Richard Ned Lebow, have sought to develop a theoretical methodology for counterfactual speculation, going beyond the rather vague and impressionistic frameworks in the counterfactual studies themselves. One conclusion is that evidence is of critical importance, and that the better documented the underpinnings of the historical event, the more convincingly one can estimate what the impact of specific changes might have been. A second point is that pattern building and comparisons with similar events can be helpful, since they offer a way of offsetting the uniqueness of the event itself. A third observation is that there is a distinction between ‘plausible’ and ‘miraculous’ changes to reality, and that the more easily it is possible to imagine a change actually occurring without requiring other complex antecedents, the more securely one may speculate about the overall effect. A fourth point is that proper attention must be paid to the likelihood that any change will trigger further consequential changes – these might magnify the disruption through a chaotic ‘butterfly effect’, or they might on the contrary damp down and offset the initial perturbation and so return later events to something more like their historical course`
